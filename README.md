## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and clearly defined. The primary goal of this phase is to understand **what the software should do** and **how it should perform** before any design or coding begins.

### Key Aspects:
- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation to understand their needs.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Organizing and documenting requirements in clear, structured formats such as functional specifications, user stories, or use cases.
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible within technical and business constraints.
- **Requirement Prioritization:** Determining which requirements are most critical to implement first based on business value, risk, and dependencies.

### Importance in SDLC:
- **Defines Project Scope:** Clearly identifies what will and will not be included, reducing ambiguity and preventing scope creep.
- **Facilitates Communication:** Serves as a reference point for developers, te

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that software is developed to meet stakeholders’ expectations and business goals. Here are three key reasons why it is important:

1. **Defines Clear Project Scope**  
   Requirement Analysis helps identify what features and functionalities are needed, preventing ambiguity and scope creep. This ensures the project stays on track and within budget.

2. **Facilitates Effective Communication**  
   By documenting and validating requirements, all stakeholders—including developers, testers, and project managers—are aligned. This reduces misunderstandings and misinterpretations during development.

3. **Reduces Risks and Costs**  
   Early identificat

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several key activities that ensure the software meets stakeholder needs and business objectives:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation to understand their needs and expectations.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Refining and exploring requirements using techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, and discussions to uncover hidden or implicit needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Organizing and recording requirements in a clear and structured format, such as functional specifications, user stories, or use cases, to serve as a reference for development.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Examining, prioritizing, and structuring requirements. Modeling techni
